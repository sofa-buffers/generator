# SofaBuffers Generator — Architecture

> **Status: C language backend complete + CI green.** This document is the
> single, up-to-date description of how the generator works and is the first
> thing a maintainer or new-language contributor should read. Keeping it current
> is part of the "done when" criterion of every milestone (PLAN §10), and it is
> updated **before every push to `main`**.
>
> **What exists today:** the language-independent core (CLI, config, parser +
> hard-gate validation, model, `$ref`/shared-type resolution, semantic checks,
> frozen IR) **plus the first language backend — C (`generators/c`)** — which
> generates `object.h`-based code that compiles, round-trips, and is byte-exact
> against the shared wire vectors. GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
> runs a hermetic core job and a per-language job (`lang-c`) on every push.
>
> **Milestone model:** each target language is a milestone — a working backend
> with its own CI job and tests, landed on `main` only when green, then on to
> the next language. Order (testable-toolchain first): **C ✓ → Go ✓ → Python ✓
> → TypeScript → C++ → (Rust / Java / C# once their toolchains are wired)**.
> Python (`generators/python`) emits dataclasses + `_marshal`/pull-parser
> `_unmarshal` against `corelib-py`; 37 shared vectors byte-exact
> (`tests/python/run.sh`, CI job `lang-python`).
> Go (`generators/golang`) emits one struct per object with `Marshal`
> (streaming `Encoder`) + a pull-parser `Unmarshal` (`Decoder.Next/Skip`)
> against `corelib-go`, with canonical-JSON struct tags; verified byte-exact on
> 37 shared vectors (`tests/go/run.sh`, CI job `lang-go`).

## 1. Overview & responsibilities

The generator is a **definition → typed-wrapper compiler**. It reads a
SofaBuffers message definition (YAML/JSON), validates it, lowers it to a
language-neutral Intermediate Representation (IR), and — once backends are
wired — emits one idiomatic, typed `serialize`/`deserialize` type per object
for a target language.

**Firm boundary:** the **corelib owns the wire format** (varints, byte order,
framing, field-skipping). The generator never touches bytes; it emits typed
calls into each corelib's public encode/decode API (PLAN §4). This is why the
core pipeline is entirely language- and wire-format-independent.

The tool **fails closed**: any validation or analysis error aborts with a
clear, located error, a non-zero exit, and **no output** (PLAN §1).

---

## 2. Architecture & patterns

The design follows four established patterns (PLAN §8):

- **Composite** — the model and IR are trees where every element implements a
  common `Node` interface (`Accept`, `Children`, `NodeName`), so traversal is
  uniform and recursive. See `internal/ir`.
- **Visitor** — generation is a `Visitor` over the IR (`VisitSchema`,
  `VisitMessage`, `VisitNamedType`, `VisitField`). A backend is one visitor
  family; new outputs (a docs visitor, a test-harness visitor) are added
  without touching the model. `ir.Walk` provides the default depth-first walk.
- **Builder** — backends will construct source files through an intent-level
  Builder API (no ad-hoc string concatenation), with formatting separated from
  content. *(Builders arrive with the first backend in M2.)*
- **Strategy** — configurable behaviour (naming, decode model, buffer mode,
  output language) is injected from the validated config, not hard-coded.

Rationale: the patterns keep the core closed for modification but open for
extension — a new language is a new package, never an edit to the core.

## 3. Pipeline / flows

```
config (§7) ┐ (resolved: defaults → generic → per-target; --in/--out override paths)
            ▼
YAML / JSON ─▶ [1] Parser     parse + hard-gate validation (resolved doc)
            ─▶ [2] Model      lower validated doc → IR nodes (refs preserved)
            ─▶ [3] Analysis   resolve shared-type graph + semantic checks
            ─▶ [4] IR         frozen, language-neutral Intermediate Representation
            ══ Language Selection Point ══   ← the ONLY place a language is chosen
            ─▶ [5] Backend    Visitor(IR) + Builder → files     (not wired in M0)
            ─▶ [6] Formatter  deterministic formatting           (with the backend)
```

Stage by stage (what it consumes → produces):

| # | Stage | Package | Consumes | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Parser | `internal/parser` | file bytes | unresolved `Document` + **validated** (hard gate) |
| 2 | Model | `internal/model` | validated, unresolved `Document` | `ir.Schema` with unresolved `TypeRef`s + hoisted inline types |
| 3 | Analysis | `internal/analysis` | `ir.Schema` | resolved shared-type graph + semantic checks |
| 4 | IR | `internal/ir` | — | the frozen Composite tree backends consume |
| 5 | Backend | `generators/<lang>` | frozen IR + effective config | `[]generator.File` |
| 6 | Formatter | (in the backend) | builder output | deterministic source |

**The language-independent core ends at stage [4].** A backend is selected only
after the IR is frozen, at the **Language Selection Point** —
`internal/generator.Lookup(lang)`. `internal/pipeline` wires the stages.

### Validation contract (stage [1])

Validation is hand-ported from `schema/README.md` because the schema relies on
Ajv-only features no stock Go validator accepts. The parser reproduces, over
the **`$ref`-resolved** document:

- the **structural** schema (types, per-width default ranges, closed objects,
  required `type`+`id`, name pattern);
- the two **`$data`** cross-field rules (string `default` ≤ `maxlen`; array
  `default` length == `items.count`);
- the six **custom keywords** — `uniqueIds` (every id scope: payload + nested
  struct/union), `uniquePositions` (bitfield), `defaultMatchesEnum`,
  `defaultIdMatchesUnion`, `blobDefaultLength` (base64-decode then compare
  bytes), `int64Range` (exact 64-bit via `math/big`, accepting integer or
  quoted string);
- **dereference-then-validate, generate-from-the-unresolved-document**: the
  validator checks the resolved tree (a dangling `$ref` fails fast), while the
  model lowers the *unresolved* document so a shared `$defs` type becomes one
  shared generated type, never duplicated (PLAN §3.4).

All problems are reported at once (`allErrors`), sorted by location.

### Two IR states (model vs analysis)

PLAN §8.2 describes a "generic model" and an "IR". In this implementation both
are the same Composite types (`internal/ir`) in two states:

- **post-Model** — `TypeRef.Target == nil` (references by key only);
- **post-Analysis** — every `TypeRef.Target` points at the single shared
  `NamedType`, semantic checks have run, and the tree is **frozen** (backends
  treat it as immutable, PLAN §8.6).

Semantic checks in M0: shared-type resolution (dangling-ref detection), and the
shared `MaxNestingDepth = 256` cap (PLAN §4.2), with recursive-struct back-edges
broken so analysis terminates.

**Package ↔ stage:** `parser`→[1], `model`→[2], `analysis`→[3], `ir`→[4],
`generators/<lang>`→[5], formatter→[6]; `pipeline` wires them; `config` feeds
all.

**Dependency rule (enforced by package boundaries):** `internal/ir` imports
nothing; the core depends only on the `internal/generator` *interface*, never on
a concrete `generators/*` package. Arrows point inward.

> *Naming note:* PLAN §8.7 sketches `cmd/codegen`; the binary is named
> `sbufgen`, so the command package is `cmd/sbufgen` to match.

## 5. How to add a new target language

This is the most important long-term workflow. To add `generators/<lang>/`:

1. Create the package with `generator.go` (the `Backend` impl), `visitor.go`
   (the IR Visitor), `builder.go` (source construction), and `templates/`.
2. Implement `generator.Backend`: `Lang() string` and
   `Generate(*ir.Schema, cfg map[string]any) ([]generator.File, error)`.
   Traverse the IR read-only; never mutate it.
3. Call `generator.Register(&backend{})` from the package `init()`, and
   blank-import the package from `cmd/sbufgen` so it self-registers.
4. Add the per-target config keys to `schema/sbufgen-config-schema.json`
   (§7.3) — keep schema and handled keys in lockstep (§7.1).
5. Add a root project / harness template + corpus entries (§9), a
   `tests/<lang>/run.sh` harness (generate → build → round-trip → conformance
   against that corelib), and a gated Go test mirroring `generators/c`.
6. Add a `lang-<x>` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs the harness, so
   the backend is CI-verified on every push.

No edits to the core model, pipeline, IR, or the message schema are required —
adding a language is purely additive. **A language milestone lands on `main`
only when its tests + CI job are green.**

### Reference backend: C (`generators/c`)

The C backend is the worked example to copy. Shape: a `gen` visitor over the IR
+ a `cfile` Builder; per object a struct + static `object.h` descriptor table +
encode/decode/init wrappers; enum→signed / bitfield→unsigned backing;
struct/union/array-of-string → nested sequence object; auto-derived capability
guards + API-version guard + analytic `MAX_SIZE` (`cost.go`). `emit: project`
adds build files + devcontainer wiring + an IR-driven encode/decode JSON harness
(`project.go`). Tests: hermetic structural + determinism, plus
`SOFAB_C_CORELIB`-gated compile/round-trip/vector-conformance (`tests/c/run.sh`).

---

## 6. Config & extension points

- **Config model (§7):** `internal/config` loads YAML/JSON, **validates against
  the embedded config schema as a hard gate** before use, and resolves the
  effective config per target with precedence *default < generic < per-target*.
  Only `--in`/`--out` override the file from the CLI.
- **Capability guards (§5.4), max-size & streaming (§5.5–§5.6):** these are
  backend concerns; the IR already carries the data a backend needs to derive
  required capabilities (the kinds/maxlens/counts per message). They arrive with
  the backends (M2+).
- **Determinism:** model/analysis sort fields by id, named types by key, enum
  consts by value, and flags by pos, so the IR — and future generated output —
  is stable for golden-diff CI (PLAN §8.6).
- **Planned future outputs:** test harnesses, docs, OpenAPI specs, and
  additional languages — all added as new Visitors, no core changes.

## 7. Milestone status

| Milestone | State |
|---|---|
| **M0 Foundations** | **done** — core pipeline (CLI, config, parser+validation, model, analysis, IR) implemented and tested; this doc created. Tag `m0`. |
| **M1 Format finalized** | **done** — schema + IR frozen; locked by a deterministic golden IR snapshot (`internal/ir/testdata/example.ir.json`) and the `--dump-ir` flag. Tag `m1`. |
| **M2 First backend (C)** | **done** — `generators/c` emits `object.h`-based struct + descriptor tables + encode/decode/init wrappers + capability guards + API-version guard + MAX_SIZE. `example.yaml` compiles **and round-trips** against the real `corelib-c-cpp` (`tests/c/run.sh`); guards verified to fire. Tag `m2`. |
| **M3 Root-project generator (C)** | **done** — `emit: project` scaffolds a buildable C project (Makefile + CMakeLists + devcontainer wiring + README) with an **IR-driven encode/decode JSON harness** (§9.1). The harness builds against `corelib-c-cpp` and JSON round-trips every field kind. Tag `m3`. |
| **M4 C conformance backbone** | **done** — drives the generated C encoder against the corelib's language-agnostic shared vectors (`assets/test_vectors.json`): **34 vectors byte-exact** (non-zero scalar/string at id 0). Sparse-encoder zero/blob/array cases are covered by the round-trip harness. `tests/c/run.sh` is the one-command backbone. Tag `m4`. |
| **Go backend** | **done** — `generators/golang`: struct + `Marshal`/pull-parser `Unmarshal` against `corelib-go`; `emit: project` Go module + stdlib-json harness; **37 shared vectors byte-exact** (dense encoder also matches zero values). `tests/go/run.sh`. |
| **Python backend** | **done** — `generators/python`: dataclasses + `_marshal`/pull-parser `_unmarshal` against `corelib-py`; stdlib-json harness (blob as `list[int]`, matching C); **37 shared vectors byte-exact**. `tests/python/run.sh`. |
| **CI** | **done + green** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: hermetic core job (build/vet/gofmt/test/cross-compile) + `lang-c` + `lang-go` + `lang-python` jobs (generate → build → round-trip → vector conformance) on every push. |
| TypeScript / C++ | next (testable here). |
| Rust / Java / C# | pending — need their toolchains wired into CI. |

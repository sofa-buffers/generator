# Python target — `targets.python`

Target-specific options, accepted under `targets.python`. Everything set in the
`generic:` section — `emit`, `license`, the `max_dyn_*` decode limits, … — is
documented once in the [generic config](README.md).

## Options

The Python target takes no options of its own — everything is set in the
[generic config](README.md).

## Receiver-side decode limits

The `max_dyn_*` caps are [generic options](README.md); what is specific to this
target is how they land in the generated code — as `MAX_DYN_ARRAY_COUNT`,
`MAX_DYN_STRING_LEN` and `MAX_DYN_BLOB_LEN` module constants, passed to the
corelib as `Decoder(max_array_count=…, max_string_len=…, max_blob_len=…)`. A
violation raises `SofaLimitError` before anything is allocated.

## Benchmark row

Row `python` in [`tests/bench/`](../../tests/bench/) (ARCHITECTURE §15), measured with
the **subtract** method. Tracked: Ir/op.

Change codegen here, then `./tests/bench/run.sh` and read the diff in
`tests/bench/results.txt`.
